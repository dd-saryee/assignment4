        <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;"> Travelling in Depression </h1>
            <p  style="font-size: x-large;">
                When I was little, I caught the travel bug. It happened after my grandparents first bought me to their home in France and I have now been 
                to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.<br/> <br/>

                A five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the city of lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza
                San Marco feeding horders of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gongolas. At thirteen, 
                I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of stoneheng and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed
                that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.<br/>
                <br/>
                It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.<br/><br/>

                It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I 
                remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. 
                But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more 
                accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.<br/><br/>
                In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its 
                similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is 
                béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible 
                to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find 
                that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in 
                Spanish.<br/><br/>
                Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied 
                Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a 
                character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by 
                combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning 
                mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love 
                spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
